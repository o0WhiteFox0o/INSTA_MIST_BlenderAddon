# INSTA_MIST_BlenderAddon
we will be creating a new add-on which will help speed up our workflow when working with Mist.

We enable the Mist Pass, Enable the Viewport Display in the camera settings, adding the Mist Options to our newly created panel but we will also arrange the compositor for this whole effect to work. So the next time we want to add Mist to our Renders we can simply press a button and let the add-on do the hard work for us.
